# Road Accident Analysis

## Tools: Power BI, SQL

## Situation
In response to the rising concerns surrounding road safety and accidents in the community, there was a critical need to conduct a comprehensive analysis of road accident data to identify patterns, contributing factors, and potential areas for intervention.

## Task
Create a Road Accident Dashboard for the years 2021 and 2022 to have insight on: 
	<br>- Total Casualties and Total Accident values for the Current Year and YoY growth
	<br>- Total Casualties by Accident Severity for Current Year and YoY growth

## Action
I have applied some techniques for this project such as: 
	<br>- Requirement Gathering
	<br>- Raw Data Overview
	<br>- Data Cleaning
	<br>- Data Processing
	<br>- Data Modelling
	<br>- Background Design
	<br>- Data Visualization
	<br>- Dashboard Building/ Report
	<br>- Insights

## Result
The project dashboard is well-designed and user-friendly with non-technical background users, as well as archives the goals to identify a better evidence-based approach to contribute to a safer road environment.
<br>
It can help answer questions/concerns related to:
	<br>- Total Casualties with respect to vehicle type for Current Year
	<br>- Monthly trend showing a comparison of casualties for the Current Year and the Previous Year
	<br>- Casualties by Road Type for Current Year
	<br>- Current Year Casualties by Area and by Day/Night
	<br>- Total Casualties and Total Accidents by Location
