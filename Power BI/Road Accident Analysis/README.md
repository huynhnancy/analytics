# Road Accident Analysis

## Tools: Power BI, SQL

## Situation
In response to the rising concerns surrounding road safety and accidents in the community, there was a critical need to conduct a comprehensive analysis of road accident data to identify patterns, contributing factors, and potential areas for intervention.

## Task
Create a Road Accident Dashboard for the years 2021 and 2022 to have insight on: 
	- Total Casualties and Total Accident values for the Current Year and YoY growth
	- Total Casualties by Accident Severity for Current Year and YoY growth

## Action
I have applied some techniques for this project such as: 
	- Requirement Gathering
	- Raw Data Overview
	- Data Cleaning
	- Data Processing
	- Data Modelling
	- Background Design
	- Data Visualization
	- Dashboard Building/ Report
	- Insights

## Result
The project dashboard is well-designed and user-friendly with non-technical background users, as well as archives the goals to identify a better evidence-based approach to contribute to a safer road environment.
